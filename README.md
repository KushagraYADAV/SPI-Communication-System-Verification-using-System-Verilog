# SPI-Communication-System-Verification-using-System-Verilog
The code implements an SPI communication module with clock generation and data transmission.
It sets up a verification environment using classes for transactions, data generation, driver, monitor, and scoreboard.
The top-level test bench module does the verification, simulating an SPI communication system and validating the accuracy of data 
transmission.
